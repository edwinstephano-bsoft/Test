# The dock, the rail down the left of the desk, is a document rather than a hook. Author it in
# Manage Dock on a developer-mode site and press Export to App, and it is written to
# `app1/dock/app1/app1.json` for git to carry. An app that ships none has no
# rail: its sidebar gets a switcher in the header instead.
#
# A companion app, one that extends a host app rather than standing on its own, says so with
# `mount_on` on that same record, and its entries are appended to the host's rail. Mounting keeps
# the companion off the apps screen, so it takes precedence over any add_to_apps_screen above.
